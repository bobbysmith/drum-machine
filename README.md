## JS-404 Drum Machine
----

JS-404 is a drum machine built from scratch using JavaScript and jQuery.  Each bank of sound has it's own unique sounds associated with the theme of the sound bank.  You are also able to record and play back your cool beats!  This was my second hackathon project built while at MakerSquare dev boot camp in Austin, TX.
